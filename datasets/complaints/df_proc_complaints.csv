The dash then stated to Shift Vehicle into Park to Restart (while still coasting at nearly 70 mph).  I managed to coast it to the emergency lane, stop the Jeep, shift into park and restart. It then would not run even remotely normal, because it was in a safety mode of some sort. Again, with the engine running completely erratically,  no coding at all. When I pressed the accelerator like normal, it would not respond at all (even putting it to the floor had no affect). I had to figure out how to get the accelerator to work so I could drive it back home.  I had to gently press the pedal to get it to respond and then the Jeep would not go above about 2500 RPM. It would force itself to slow down if it reached any higher RPM.   I went to the local Jeep Dealership ASAP today and was told nothing was recorded in the computer, software is up to date, and there is nothing wrong with my Jeep.   This is a serious problem and has to be diagnosed and fixed!!!!",Vehicle,2021,JEEP,WRANGLER

The invoice said the alignment was checked and it was “ok,” December 24 – Florida gets a cold front and we experienced temperatures in the low 20’s with the high temperature peaking at 32 or 33 degrees for a couple days. I drive my normal route on the highway and as I am approaching 65 mph, I go over a transition from asphalt to concrete bridge and the car starts to do the death wobble, where a strong vibration from the front end shook the car until I let off the gas and slowed down to about 40mph. my sister-in-law also experienced in her 2020 Jeep, the same day the freeze set in. Ive had steering gearbox changed and two stabilizers replaced already, JEEP TSB once stated: JL JT have unique torque values for ball joints as compared to prior JK models due to material (aluminum knuckles) and design changes. I guarantee its the crappy ball joints and they REFUSE to admit it. Jeep still claims they cant duplicate the issue or i need to replace tires (that are wearing unevenly bc of ball joint issues) befor they can continue diagnosis. 4 different dealerships. 4 different outcomes. even [XXX]  from their corporate office stopped responding to me.

The two vertical welds failed with the remaining welds being at the top of the spring perch.  The only indications of a problem were an occasional knocking sound when going over a bump and severe vibration coming from the rear of the vehicle. The noise was caused by the spring perch flexing and tapping the bottom of the body.  I believe the welds broke early this year but the source of the noise wasn't found until July 2023.  With prolonged use in this condition the spring perch can completely fail causing the spring and perch to fall out and make the driver lose control.  The dealership submitted pictures and the manufacturer has agreed to replace the entire frame.  There are a handful of other people that have reported the same problem (always on the passenger rear) but because of the design, I suspect as these vehicles age stress fractures in the weld will make this issue more prevalent.",Vehicle,2021,JEEP,WRANGLER

On Wednesday May 31, 2023, immediately upon starting the Jeep engine and the AC fan starting I had a severe allergic reaction while driving that resulted in me having to pull over and administer my EPI pen and use my inhaler. At the time my soft top was off as were the windows and doors.  On Sunday, June 1st, the next time I got into my Jeep to drive the same thing happened. This time the doors/windows and soft top were attached. The the only constant variables to the allergic reactions were my Jeep and running the air conditioning. Today ran my Jeep engine in my driveway (it is currently 83 degrees in St. Louis) and ran the air conditioner for 30 minutes and there was NO fluid under the Jeep from condensation from the AC running. I believe the AC condensate line is clogged, and that there is mold on the AC evaporator, both causing my entire AC system and entire vehicle to be contaminated with mold causing both my anaphylactic reactions. The mold allergy is life threatening to me. The mold is also life threatening to the general public if I am driving and unable to maintain control of the vehicle due to anaphylaxis caused by the mold in the vehicle and AC system. The risk I would need to assume, if I choose to drive the Jeep again is unacceptable - and I will not take that risk. Additionally, I will not cause or assume liability for any harm caused to the public that results from an anaphylactic reaction of increasing severity to mold while driving the Jeep, which would likely temporarily incapacitate me and render me unable to control the Jeep.

I was extremely frightened, fearing I might have a wreck or cause someone else to wreck if control of my Jeep were lost. My heart beat sped up, my hands clinched the steering wheel. I was able to slow down and the wobble went away but my anxiety did not go away. It happened about 4 more times that day on the interstate. I was traveling and concerned about my safety and that of others. I was also concerned about what was happening with my Jeep, how could I fix it, COULD it be fixed, and how was I going to pay for it.  I thought the front end of my Jeep needed to be re-aligned so I took it to the dealership I bought it from, they inspected it and said it did not alignment. Said the Jeep had developed a ""wobble."" I was told that parts to fix this issue were not available in the U.S. and they had no ETA on when/if a part would be available. They took my phone number and said they would call if something changed. Now I have a Jeep that I am afraid of - actually terrified of. I only drive on the city streets and stay away from the interstate. My life has been limited in so many way because of this issue. I was not issued any paperwork on this problem.",Vehicle,2021,JEEP,WRANGLER

Tire Details:  Bridgestone Dueler A/T, Size 255/70R18, Load Index:  133T, Speed Rating:  M+S, DOT/Tire ID#:  93XJ RHF 4820.   In November 2022, we experienced a catastrophic sidewall blowout of the passenger side front tire while driving 75-80 mph in the high speed lane on I-75.  We were instantly warned by the dashboard automatic tire pressure monitoring system.  The tire pressure dropped from normal to zero in a matter of 100 yards.  This warning saved our lives. To this day, I still don’t know how we got the Jeep safely over to the emergency lane on the right side of I-75 during high traffic.  Key point to note – we only had approximately 30,000 miles on our tires at the time of the incident. We called Florida’s Road Rangers who put our spare tire on the vehicle.  When we got to our destination, we took it to the Okeechobee Jeep Dealer.  The Service Manager and Mechanic both said they had never seen a sidewall blown out like this tire.  They recommended we contact Bridgestone to notify them of a safety complaint and possible monetary credit. At their recommendation we took detailed pictures of the blown tire.  The Dealer pitched the blown tire as we had a car full of luggage.   We purchased a new Bridgestone tire from this Jeep Dealer at that time as we did not want to ride around with no spare.  We were not sure of the integrity of the remaining 3 tires.   We contacted Bridgestone, Ref # 1387342.  After talking to a series of Reps, they seemed indifferent about this unsafe event and said they could do nothing on the tire warranty since we did not go to an authorized Bridgestone dealer.  A Rep said if we had the original tire they would warranty it, but the pictures would not suffice!   I came away with the sense that Bridgestone does not have any concern about their tire safety. They never asked for the pictures or the DOT/Tire Identification number. They did not stand behind their tires from a warranty aspect.",Vehicle,2021,JEEP,WRANGLER

I was going only 55 when I only drove over two, when suddenly my steering wheel and while Jeep started shaking violently. I let my foot off the accelerator , letting the Jeep slow down to under 50 when it finally stopped. It was very frightening to me and my daughter and called the dealership immediately to report the issue and was very nervous to drive it again. After inspection at the dealership I was told they couldn’t find a problem so I took off feeling maybe it was just a freak thing. But then a month later the same thing happened, but this time I was coming down a steep grade around 60mph  when there was a small divot that I ran over and again the steering wheel shacking violently and the whole Jeep shaking worse then the first time. I tried not to break and let my foot off the accelerator again, but this time the Jeep wouldn’t slow down by its self because I was going down hill. I thought I was going to loose control of the vehicle and crash. Shaking, I pulled over and called the dealership immediately. I told them I was afraid to drive the vehicle and I wanted it taken care of immediately. I had to have my husband drive it to the dealership for me, because I was to scared.

Did some research, apparently this is an ongoing issue that is getting reported to Chrysler and the NHTSA already with possible ""fixes"" being replacement dampeners or a new steering box.  I don't know what Chrysler will do at this time as the diagnosis date is in the future but... a replacement dampener seems to only bandaid the issue.  The real issue is some other fault that wears the dampener down early.  Replacing it or upgrading it only hides the fault.  I believe they are making progress with the idea that the aluminum steering box stretches and needs to be steel but can't say 100%.

Then without any warning, the Jeep went into limp mode from 70mph-50mph. With no notice, we were thrown forward due to the sudden decrease in speed. This action caused the vehicles behind us to swerve to avoid collision.  My adaptive cruise control shut itself off and the electronic throttle control warning light started flashing.  My throttle control was weak and unreliable, taking a lot of pedal to respond and then not needing hardly any pedal and would surge forward with sudden speed. It was a very dangerous situation. We continued driving in limp mode as there were no safe locations to stop and we  didn’t have any cell service. Both malfunction lights remained on and we drove straight to our dealer. They said the EGR cooler failed and clogged up all of the EGR system with soot and then burned out the catalytic converter. They were able to clear the soot out of the system and cleared the malfunction lights so we could drive it home as they didn't have any loaners to offer us. The service advisor told us if we had another vehicle we should park the Jeep and not drive it until the parts come in. They have no ETA on either the EGR cooler nor the catalytic converter.

Prior to this incident I also noticed that the charge would not hold very long at all - for example, driving it today 3.4 miles from one point to the dealer, the charge went from 47% to 17% - this should not be normal. Overall this issue is unacceptable and this needs to be addressed immediately before people die. Thanks for your consideration.",Vehicle,2021,JEEP,WRANGLER

Now, a few days later, the visor will not stay in place and keeps dropping randomly as I drive. This issue is well documented on Wrangler owner forums and creates a safety hazard as visibility is impaired.

We were traveling slowly on a dirt road in our new Jeep. Suddenly it began to slow down and it stopped. It would not move any further. The shifter was frozen in Park. Lights and warnings were illuminated on the dash that were not on before this happened. We were in a wilderness and had no cell reception whatsoever. It would not start, drive or otherwise move. Eventually someone came by and took us into a small town where we called the dealer for assistance. They told us to call Jeep Roadside Assistance. We came close to having to spend the night out there in 40 degree weather with no ability to walk out 14 miles in total darkness. The Jeep was towed to the dealer where it remains 7 days later. It has 183 miles on it. Purchased it on May 29 and it broke down on June 2. The failure seemed to be electrical and across the board. It is the 4XE Hybrid, and the internet is littered with stories just like ours of this Jeep failing and stranding people or stopping on freeways or in intersections.

Since the electric mode distance is limited, the car has a hybrid and gas-only mode that runs on gas for when the battery needs a charge after 30 miles. The following problem occurred over 10 times in a 2 day timeframe:   The vehicle gave a dashboard warning that stated ""service charging system"" and ""service transmission"" plus my Jeep app gave a message ""a charge fault has occurred."" Within 10 seconds, the entire car shut off. At the time, I was going 60 mph on a freeway. This nearly caused a 10-car pile up, but I was fortunately able to get onto the shoulder despite the entire electrical system shutting down. I was lucky, because after 10 seconds, the car came to an immediate stop and I could not move it at all. At the time, I had two-thirds full tank of gas.   I was able to start the engine about 15 minutes later. Shortly thereafter, the same problem occurred again after about 5 minutes of driving. This sequence repeated itself over 10 times until I was able to get towed to a nearby dealership. I was advised that the battery needed to be charged and this problem would not occur. This is an unacceptable explanation, since this vehicle has a gas-only mode to account for the 30 mile electrical battery distance. The following day, I got a full charge, but the problem happened again on the freeway, this time with 20% battery remaining and a one-half tank of gas. I had to get towed for the second time in two days.   This is a very dangerous problem. This car should be recalled. Someone could have died due to the car completely shutting off while on a freeway and coming to a total half after only 10 seconds.   The Jeep 4xe online forum reports 10 separate episodes of the same problem. I have attached a pdf of the formum to prove this is a recurrent issue.
